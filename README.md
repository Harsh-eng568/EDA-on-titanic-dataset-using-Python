# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

Performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean data, handle missing values, and uncover survival trends. Implemented univariate and multivariate analysis through visualizations like histograms, KDE plots, and pie charts. Additionally, leveraged cross-tabulation techniques to compare survival rates across different passenger attributes, providing data-driven insights into key survival factors.

# Situation:

The Titanic dataset contained missing values and inconsistencies, impacting data reliability.


# Task: 

Ensure data quality by handling null values and preparing it for analysis.


# Action: 

Cleaned the dataset by filling or removing missing values and applied feature engineering for better insights.

# Result: 

Improved data integrity, enabling accurate exploratory data analysis (EDA).
